### N-Body Problem
The Barnes-Hut algorithm is a proposed solution to the n-body problem; namely, how do we simulate n-bodies, where each body acts on every other body?

In this project, both the Barnes-Hut approach and Naive approach are implemented. The former is an approximation of the real physics and runs in O(nlogn) time, while the latter is the true physics and runs in O(n^2) time.
